#### How does your gem take advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities?

My gem takes advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming abilites in the following ways.

1. It uses `send` to call methods on a string

2. It uses `define method` to dynamically define methods



#### How long did you spend on this project?
1. I spent 3 days on the project for a total of about 20 hours

### What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

1. Understanding how to use the define method was the most difficult for me.

### Where do you still have room to grow?
1. I feel I have only just scratched the surface with Ruby Metaprogramming, I am looking for more avenues to explore the topic further.
